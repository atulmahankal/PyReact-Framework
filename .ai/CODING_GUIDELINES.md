## Coding Rules

- DRY, secure, performant code
- Follow architecture strictly

## DRY, Async, and Stack Guidance

- Follow DRY principles.
- Prefer async/await patterns for backend code where the framework supports it to improve concurrency and memory efficiency.
- Use modern libraries consistent with project conventions (e.g., SQLAlchemy 2.0 style, Pydantic v2) when applicable — only if already used in the project or requested.
